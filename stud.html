<h2><p align="center" style="color:black">   The ideal college lifestyle dissipates
 quickly once the reality is reached. Many young adults imagine vivid pictures of what 
college might be like for them. However, once these young adults mature into independent
 men and women, and enter into the school of their choice, they soon realize the
 reality of the college lifestyle. They must learn to adapt to their new surroundings
 as quickly as possible to accomplish the sought after degrees. Students come to the
 realization that life is not as easy as they might hope for. </p></h2>
